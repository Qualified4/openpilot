"""CCNC lane line colour/shape from the display-only lane marking recogniser (Scanner/StripNet).

Applied per side to the existing lane code only where the existing policy shows a normal line (white 2 or
lane-change-available green 6). Priority: recognised yellow -> orange solid 4 (also over green);
otherwise the existing green condition keeps green with the recognised shape (solid 6 / dashed 10);
otherwise white with the recognised shape (solid 2 / dashed 8). UNKNOWN, expired or disabled leaves the
existing code untouched (SideDisplay's lapsed grey and start-up hide aside), as do grey 0 (low confidence), hidden lines,
departure blinking and the existing warning orange, which are decided outside this function. Display only: lane-change permission is not read or changed.

``marking`` is card's latest parsed packet: {'left': {'type': (value, expires_ns)|None, 'color': ...}, ...}.

  """Display memory of one side (display only; no control input is read or written).

  - hold: the last fresh type and the last fresh colour (each head separately) fill a missing head for HOLD_S while
    driving and without a time limit while stopped or creeping (v < HOLD_STOP_SPEED, 2 m/s: slow queues) or changing
    lanes (blinker, desire, laneChangeState: the last confirmed line stays through the change; the HOLD_S clock
    restarts when it ends);
    a new fresh value replaces it at once.
  - lapsed grey (``enabled``, the recogniser option on): once a head's hold has run out while driving, the line is
    shown grey 0 instead of the existing solid-looking base until the recogniser confirms that head again. Only a
    head the code needs counts: the colour always, the type only for a white line (yellow is orange solid either
    way). While changing lanes a head whose hold already ran out shows its last confirmed value again (DaBin, 10-20).
  - unseen (``enabled``): no colour confirmed since start (card start) -> hidden 14 instead of the solid-looking base
    (DaBin, 10-20: no white solid before an orange line is recognised). No timeout: a recogniser that never confirms
    keeps the line hidden. ``enabled`` False leaves the existing base.
  - green (lane change available) turns on only after GREEN_ON_S of continuous availability, off at once.
  - low: lane prob < LOW_PROB_OFF for LOW_PROB_S (1.5 s) of continuous driving -> grey 0; released at >= LOW_PROB_OFF;
    frozen while stopped (v < STOP_SPEED, 0.5 m/s). Was < 0.3 for 1 s: in intersections the prob wanders 0.1-0.45 and
    rarely stayed below 0.3 for 1 s, so the last line stayed on through them (10-20 review, item 3).
    Not while changing lanes once a colour has been confirmed (no speed condition, DaBin 10-20): low is off and does not
    accumulate, so the last confirmed line stays through the change, also when grey was already on as it started.
    Before any confirmation low applies as before. There is no creeping-distance hide here: ccnc_parking.ParkingLaneHide
    already hides lines in a car park.

"""CCNC lane marking recogniser process (display only): StripNet, with the model slot chosen by LaneStripModel.

The model (strip_model.load_slot: 0 the deployed assets/lane_strip.*, 1 the new assets/lane_strip_v4.*, falling back to the deployed one with a warning when those files are missing or
invalid) is loaded at start and the param is polled every
PARAM_CHECK_S; a change hot-swaps the model without a restart and starts the strip filter, dip timers and display filter from
empty (Recogniser.swap_model). The active model (slot, manifest version, sha256 prefix) is logged and carried in every packet's 'model' entry. The profile Scanner (Recogniser mode 1) is kept for
offline replays only and never runs here.

Runs outside modeld/controlsd/card. Every new full-resolution road camera NV12 frame goes into a small buffer
of the newest FRAME_BUFFER frames (older ones are dropped; buffers are camerad's shared memory, referenced not
copied). For each new modelV2 the frame the model actually used (same frameId and EOF) is taken first; if it
is not buffered, the frame whose EOF is nearest the model's timestampEof (the model's input frame time, not its
receive time) within MAX_FRAME_OFFSET_NS, with the model's lane geometry shifted by the travel in between. The selected recogniser's
per-frame result goes through the existing display filter (display.DisplayPolicy: two identical results
within 0.4 s, 0.5 s expiry); the confirmed left/right type/colour, their age and timing are published on
customReservedRawData2 for card to read without waiting. No CAN, steering, longitudinal or lane-change
decision is computed here.
